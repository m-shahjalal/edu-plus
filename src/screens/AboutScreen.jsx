						At Capstone, we believe there is a better way to provide
						education. A more interesting and effective way where
						students can learn rather than just attend classes.
						Weâ€™re obsessively passionate about it, and our mission
						is to help students achieve their dream. We focus on
						studentsâ€™ learning. Learning has been the least
						emphasized aspect of our education and we see that as an
						opportunity: Weâ€™re excited to simplify Education for
						everyone through our guidance, care, and inspiration
